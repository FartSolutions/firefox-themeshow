# Theme Show (v1.1)
The Random Theme Changer is a Firefox extension that enriches the visual experience of Firefox users by automatically changing the installed themes. The extension randomly changes the theme at set intervals (every minute by default), making browsing visually more dynamic and personalized.

## Main features
- Automatic theme change: The extension automatically and randomly changes the active theme at an interval you specify (every minute by default).
- Timer control: Users can enable or disable the timer at will, providing flexibility in the use of the automatic change function.
- Theme selection: Users have the option to exclude certain themes from the change list. This is particularly useful if there are themes that do not meet personal preferences or the requirements of the working environment.

## Usage
After installation, the extension icon is located in the Firefox toolbar. Click on the icon to open the settings menu where you can:

- Switch the timer on or off.
- Disable certain themes for the switch.
- See current theme name.
